### Project Initialization
- **Task:** Initialize React + Vite project ([tasks.md] Project Setup)
- **Command:** `npm create vite@latest . -- --template react-ts`
- **Result:** Success. Vite + React + TypeScript scaffold created in project root. Chose 'service-app' as package name, React as framework, TypeScript as variant. No errors reported.
- **Context:** This is the foundational step for the Service Industry App, as required by the project setup tasks and rules.md. All further frontend work will build on this scaffold.

### Install Project Dependencies
- **Task:** Install dependencies ([tasks.md] Project Setup)
- **Command:** `npm install`
- **Result:** Success. 188 packages added, 0 vulnerabilities. No errors or warnings.
- **Context:** Ensures all dependencies for the Vite scaffold are present before further setup.

### Install TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Autoprefixer
- **Task:** Install TailwindCSS and configure with PostCSS ([tasks.md] Project Setup)
- **Command:** `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer`
- **Result:** Success. 5 packages added, 0 vulnerabilities. No errors or warnings.
- **Context:** Required for Tailwind utility classes and modern CSS processing.

### Install shadcn/ui Component Library
- **Task:** Install component library (tasks.md)
- **Command:** `npm install shadcn-ui`
- **Result:** Success. shadcn/ui and dependencies installed. No errors or vulnerabilities reported.
- **Context:** This provides the base UI component system for the app, enabling rapid, accessible, and consistent UI development per Figma and Atomic Design guidelines.

### Attempt to Initialize TailwindCSS Config
- **Task:** Generate TailwindCSS and PostCSS config files ([tasks.md] Project Setup)
- **Command:** `npx tailwindcss init -p`
- **Result:** **Failure.** Error: "npm error could not determine executable to run". Log file: `C:\Users\stape\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_logs\2025-07-15T00_48_30_169Z-debug-0.log`
- **Context:** This command is required to create `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`. The error may be due to a fresh install or shell environment. Next step: retry the command or investigate the error log if it persists.

### Attempt to Initialize shadcn/ui
- **Task:** Install component library (tasks.md)
- **Command:** `npx shadcn-ui init` (deprecated), then `npx shadcn@latest init`
- **Result:**
  - shadcn-ui is deprecated; recommended to use `shadcn` package.
  - Initialization failed: No Tailwind CSS configuration found, and no import alias in tsconfig.json.
- **Context:** shadcn/ui setup requires a valid Tailwind config and import alias. Next step: Fix Tailwind config, then re-run shadcn/ui init.

### shadcn/ui Initialization Blocked by Tailwind Config
- **Task:** Install component library (tasks.md)
- **Command:** `npx shadcn@latest init`
- **Result:**
  - Initialization failed: Tailwind config found but not valid (content array is empty).
  - shadcn/ui expects a properly configured Tailwind content array.
- **Context:** Next step: update tailwind.config.js content array to include all relevant source files (e.g., './index.html', './src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}').

### Tailwind Config Generation Troubleshooting
- **Task:** Install TailwindCSS and configure with PostCSS (tasks.md)
- **Commands:**
  - `npm cache clean --force`
  - `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules,package-lock.json`
  - `npm install`
  - `npx tailwindcss init -p`
- **Result:**
  - Cache cleaned, dependencies reinstalled successfully.
  - Tailwind config generation still fails: "npm error could not determine executable to run".
- **Context:** Environment is clean, but Tailwind CLI cannot be executed. Further investigation required (possible npm, path, or package issue).

### Tailwind Config Issue Remediation
- **Task:** Install TailwindCSS and configure with PostCSS (tasks.md)
- **Commands:**
  - `npm uninstall tailwindcss`
  - `npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.3`
  - Confirmed CLI binary in node_modules/.bin
  - `npx tailwindcss init -p`
- **Result:**
  - TailwindCSS 3.4.3 installed, CLI binary present.
  - Successfully generated tailwind.config.js and postcss.config.js.
- **Context:** Issue was caused by Tailwind v4 incompatibility or missing binary. Project is now unblocked for shadcn/ui setup.

### shadcn/ui Initialization Still Blocked (Tailwind Detection)
- **Task:** Install component library (tasks.md)
- **Command:** `npx shadcn@latest init` (after fixing Tailwind config and import alias)
- **Result:**
  - Initialization still fails: shadcn/ui cannot detect Tailwind config, even though it exists and is valid.
  - Noted that tailwind.config.js uses ESM (export default), but shadcn/ui may expect CommonJS (module.exports).
- **Context:** Next step: convert tailwind.config.js to CommonJS format and retry initialization.

### Tailwind CLI Functional, shadcn/ui Detection Still Fails
- **Task:** Install component library (tasks.md)
- **Command:** `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./public/output.css --watch`
- **Result:**
  - Tailwind CLI runs successfully, config is valid, and CSS is generated.
  - shadcn/ui CLI still cannot detect Tailwind config, likely due to a bug or limitation in its detection logic.
- **Context:** As a workaround, components from shadcn/ui can be manually imported and configured. Documenting this for future reference.
