# üìã TASKS.md ‚Äì Full Project Task Breakdown

*All development tasks must follow the provided Figma prototype designs, adhering strictly to best practices, accessibility standards, and the Atomic Design System. The project uses a Supabase MCP server for backend automation and a GitHub MCP server for deployment workflows.*

# üö® BLOCKER: Resolve Vite/Radix UI Import & Peer Dependency Errors

* [x] Fix Vite import error: Failed to resolve import "@radix-ui/react-tabs" (and any similar errors for Radix UI or other atomic dependencies)

> This file will expand with more tasks as the Figma prototype is analyzed and broken into components and flows. All features must implement the approved Figma design and follow the best practices documented in rules.md.

## üõ† GitHub & CI Setup

* [x] Initialize local git repository
* [x] Create/connect to GitHub repository

* [ ] Set up automated backups and environment sync
* [ ] Log all MCP automation actions in dev-log.md

## üõ† Figma Reference Build Errors (Non-Production)

* [x] Identify all Figma Design/components/ui files causing Vite import errors
* [x] Remove or comment out all invalid imports (e.g., @radix-ui/react-avatar@1.1.3) in Figma reference files
* [x] Add a README note: Figma Design directory is for reference only and not part of the build
* [x] Ensure Vite build passes with Figma Design directory present
* [x] Document all actions in dev-log.md

> All Figma Design imports have been removed from app code. Placeholders are in place for atomic/molecule/organism migration. See dev-log.md for details.

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

* [ ] [Calendar] Test runner/module resolution issue with cn utility import (see dev-log.md for troubleshooting and next steps)
* [ ] [General] Review all ported primitives for ESM/CJS compatibility and test runner import hygiene
* [ ] Investigate and resolve test runner/TypeScript config issues preventing AddJobForm tests from running (paused)
  - Research shows this is a known Vitest/React issue, often related to index file exports, ESM/CJS interop, or shared utilities.
  - Error occurs with any real atom reintroduced, but not with mocks; all atom tests pass in isolation.
  - Next steps for future resumption:
    1. Try direct import of atoms in test (not via index).
    2. Review atoms index file for export issues.
    3. Check for problematic shared utilities.
* [ ] Incrementally reintroduce real atom components in AddJobForm test to isolate test runner error (paused)
* [ ] [Dependency] React 19 vs react-day-picker@8.10.1 conflict: Downgrade react and react-dom to ^18.3.1, react-router-dom to ^6.28.0. Verify all tests and builds after change. (See dev-log.md for details)

## Dev Environment

* [ ] [KNOWN ISSUE] Ensure Supabase CLI is recognized in all dev environments (Cursor/editor and user terminal); document any required steps

## üîÑ Refactor: Dashboard vs. Jobs Page Responsibilities

**Goal:**
Ensure the Dashboard is view-only (shows jobs in calendar, table, kanban, etc.) and the Jobs page is for adding/managing jobs (no multi-view display).

### Tasks & Subtasks

1. **Audit Current Implementation**
   - [x] Review Dashboard page for job views (calendar, table, kanban).
   - [x] Review Jobs page for job views and job management features.

2. **Refactor Pages**
   - [x] Move all job view components (calendar, table, kanban) to Dashboard.
   - [x] Ensure Jobs page contains only job creation and management features (add, edit, delete).

3. **Update Navigation**
   - [ ] Update navigation labels and routes to reflect new structure.

4. **Update Tests**
   - [ ] Update or add unit tests for Dashboard (view-only).
   - [ ] Update or add unit tests for Jobs page (add/edit/delete only).

5. **Update Documentation**
   - [ ] Update README.md with new page purposes and user flow.
   - [ ] Add dev-log.md entry for this change.
   - [ ] Update tasks.md with this checklist.
