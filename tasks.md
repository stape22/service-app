# Note: Only these four are top-level pages per Figma navigation. Add/Edit entity screens (e.g., add-customer, edit-job) are subviews or modals, not separate routes.

## üìÜ Supabase Data Models

* [x] Create users table with roles: admin, roofer, customer
* [x] Create roofers table (name, email, phone)
* [x] Create customers table (name, address, email, phone)

* [x] Enable RLS and set access policies per role

## üìÇ Dashboard Features

### Jobs

* [x] View job list (table)
* [ ] Add new job
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: implement basic info section (Job Number, Customer, etc.)
  * [ ] AddJobForm molecule: unit test for basic info section
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: implement status, priority, estimated cost, description, notes section
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: unit test for status, priority, estimated cost, description, notes section
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: implement scheduled date section (Calendar + Popover)
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: unit test for scheduled date section
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: implement advanced sections (roofing specs, drawing, photos, submission)
    * [ ] [POST-MVP] Port DrawingCanvas molecule (full interactive drawing, undo/redo, export, etc.)
    * [ ] [MVP] Placeholder or omit DrawingCanvas for MVP; document in dev-log.md
    * [ ] [POST-MVP] Port PhotoUpload molecule (full photo upload, preview, category, etc.)
    * [ ] [MVP] Placeholder or omit PhotoUpload for MVP; document in dev-log.md
  * [x] AddJobForm molecule: unit test for advanced sections
* [ ] Edit job
* [ ] Delete job
* [ ] Kanban view by status
* [ ] Calendar view by due date

### Roofers

* [ ] View roofer list
* [ ] Add new roofer
* [ ] Edit roofer
* [ ] Delete roofer

### Customers

* [ ] View customer list
* [ ] Add new customer
* [ ] Edit customer
* [ ] Delete customer

## üìä UX Polish

* [ ] Handle Supabase errors with toasts
* [ ] Make layout responsive for mobile
* [ ] Add 404 page and route guard
* [ ] Optimize Tailwind and remove unused styles

---

> This file will expand with more tasks as the Figma prototype is analyzed and broken into components and flows. All features must implement the approved Figma design and follow the best practices documented in rules.md.

## üõ† GitHub & CI Setup

* [x] Initialize local git repository
* [x] Create/connect to GitHub repository
* [x] Add remote origin and push code

* [ ] Automate RLS policy creation and updates
* [ ] Add scripts/tasks for database seeding and test data
* [ ] Set up automated backups and environment sync
* [ ] Log all MCP automation actions in dev-log.md

## üõ† Figma Reference Build Errors (Non-Production)

* [x] Identify all Figma Design/components/ui files causing Vite import errors
* [x] Remove or comment out all invalid imports (e.g., @radix-ui/react-avatar@1.1.3) in Figma reference files
* [x] Add a README note: Figma Design directory is for reference only and not part of the build
* [x] Ensure Vite build passes with Figma Design directory present
* [x] Document all actions in dev-log.md

> All Figma Design imports have been removed from app code. Placeholders are in place for atomic/molecule/organism migration. See dev-log.md for details.

## Known Issues / Technical Debt

* [ ] [Calendar] Test runner/module resolution issue with cn utility import (see dev-log.md for troubleshooting and next steps)
* [ ] [General] Review all ported primitives for ESM/CJS compatibility and test runner import hygiene
* [ ] Investigate and resolve test runner/TypeScript config issues preventing AddJobForm tests from running (paused)
  - Research shows this is a known Vitest/React issue, often related to index file exports, ESM/CJS interop, or shared utilities.
  - Error occurs with any real atom reintroduced, but not with mocks; all atom tests pass in isolation.
  - Next steps for future resumption:
    1. Try direct import of atoms in test (not via index).
    2. Review atoms index file for export issues.
    3. Check for problematic shared utilities.
* [ ] Incrementally reintroduce real atom components in AddJobForm test to isolate test runner error (paused)
* [ ] [Dependency] React 19 vs react-day-picker@8.10.1 conflict: Downgrade react and react-dom to ^18.3.1, react-router-dom to ^6.28.0. Verify all tests and builds after change. (See dev-log.md for details)

## Dev Environment

* [ ] [KNOWN ISSUE] Ensure Supabase CLI is recognized in all dev environments (Cursor/editor and user terminal); document any required steps
